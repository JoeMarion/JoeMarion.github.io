###**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that margin is applied to the outside of the element and padding is on the inside. This can be useful depending on what kind of styling you are working with. I found I was using all three to manipulate the page to get it how I wanted it.

###**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that CSS positioning is harder than I want it to be. This isn't the first time I have tried to learn CSS, but I am slowly picking up on things. I want to work on cleaning up my code and making it more easily read. I find that I go down the rabbit hole making changes and not label them as much as I should be.

###**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Surprisingly enough the nav bar was the easiest for me to implement. I had fun with it and tried to make it dynamic. I even added my first amount of javascript to activate a class so that it would collapse into a single menu bar if it was on a mobile platform.

The hardest to implement was keeping my description page at the bottom. I am going to put content in between the where my brief description about me and the main video so when I change it I know how I will implement it, but trying to keep it at the bottom of the page and not the viewport was hard for me.

###**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that using Chrome's devtools was helpful in the process. At first I was just adding to my CSS file and refreshing, but Chrome's tools helped me identify where I wanted to change.
