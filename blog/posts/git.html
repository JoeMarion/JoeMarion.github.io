      <h1>Beginning DBC!</h1>
      <h4>15 September 2015</h4>
    </header>

    <p>Dev Bootcamp has started and has hit the ground running! After week one there was a decent amount of ground covered and I wanted to review some of the things that were taught within the first week or so. What better way than to begin the blog with the material covered.</p>

    <p>Something that has a very clear importance, especially at DBC so far is version control. Version control is a way of tracking your project from the beginning of development and keeping a log of every "version" of the code's development. This can be very beneficial because the nature of how version control is stored. The version control method we've been using so far is Git and it is hosted on Github. What I have noticed from using Git is that it is similar to keeping a timeline of your project and having the ability to go back to previous versions of code if needed. This is useful because if you were testing a new feature you were unsure of or if you had already made a mistake you can go back to previous iterations of the project that still has functional code intact. So far using Git has been pretty intuitive after picking up the basic commands and I am constantly learning new functions that can help further improve your code.</p>

    <p>Git is a type of version control and Github (Github.com) is just a git hosting service. Github has been useful because it keeps a copy of the code online. As far as practicality within DBC so far, it has allowed me to constantly keep both my home and work computers synced. I can bring my laptop to work and work on assignments. After I get home I can push my changes up to Github, then update my much larger home computer to work on. It has much more benefits than just syncing computers though. It allows teams to copy other people's repositories into their own and work on a copy of the code without effecting others repos. As a team this can be useful because people can essentially work on the same repo, and update the master file with their changes.</p>
