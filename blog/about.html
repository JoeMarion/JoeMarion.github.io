      <p>Our mission is to make it. Plain and simple we are just trying to make it in this world, make it in our lives, just make it... make it in our own way. We are tired of doing things society's way and have decided to travel on a more up-beat path. We are quitting our regular nine-to-five and deciding to make life an experience. An experience worth not forgetting. We invite you to take this journey with us.</p>

      <p>My name is Joe Marion and I was born and raised in Chandler, AZ. Shortly after high school I joined the U.S. Air Force. I spent five years in the USAF as a TACP JTAC, but after spending so much time away from home after my daughter was born I felt it was time for a new career despite how much I loved the actual job. I knew that I wouldn't be able to go from a job that I enjoyed so much to one I didn't care for.. no matter the salery. I put a lot of thought into what I would enjoy the most.</p>

      <p>When I first became a TACP I was constantly on the lookout for things that could make life easier for my successors. The most notable is my pre-test work. I have always enjoyed working on computers and learning the process behind them, so when I saw how much testable material that our job required I wanted to create something that made it easier to study. At the time, the people I was working with would make 500-700 flash cards on index paper to study for their slew of tests that we had to stay current on. I immediately thought it was ridiculous because the material was constantly updating, forcing people to create entirely new libraries of flashcards. This was the start, I began to learn how to use excel's macros to build my first "program" that was essentially just a group of quizzes that I could update and email out every time a new quiz came out.</p>

      <p>A year and a lot of great feedback later, I decided that I wanted to try and create an iPhone app based off of the quiz. Most people would take time at work to study the quiz on the computer, but it was still a little too inconvenient for our work environment when we only had 2-3 government computers accessible. I decided to jump right in. I nervously bought my first Mac (after considering myself a loyal PC user) and consumed myself to create any MVP for my app. What I would have never expected was how much I enjoyed creating it. It was very challenging, and at the beginning there were times that I was certain that I was just incapable of completing it.. but when I had finished my first MVP, all the frustration had been worth it. The challenge and the amount of problem solving made me really have to think again, and I loved it.</p>

      <p>This journey has extended further than just a job. It really has given me a different outlook on how I want to live the rest of my life. Originally I had planned on continueing working for the government and attempting to  move towards a three-letter agency like the CIA or FBI. This has made me realize that there is more to life than just appearances and titles. Life is about living and just going for it. That's why we are Making it with the Marions, this is a story about how we are going to live our lives. Everyone makes it their own way. This is how we are going to.</p>

      <p>Ever since I have changed my outlook, I have taken a much different approach on how I look at my entire life. Our family has decided that after missing out on a lot of time together and being stuck in a somewhat remote location that we want to spend time travelling the United States. We purchased an RV and plan to visit anywhere and everywhere on the way. I would prefer to get a remote job and be able to work on this blog.</p>

        Here is where I am going to type up a brief description of myself and a little about my experience. Most of my information can be located in the about page where I will link to myself from here.
